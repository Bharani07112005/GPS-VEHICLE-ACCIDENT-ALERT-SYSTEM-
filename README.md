🚗 GPS Vehicle Accident Alert System
📌 Overview

The GPS Vehicle Accident Alert System is designed to improve road safety by automatically detecting accidents and sending emergency alerts with the vehicle’s real-time location. It combines GPS for accurate tracking, GSM for instant communication, and sensors for accident detection, ensuring faster response times and potentially saving lives.

🎯 Objective

Detect accidents automatically using vibration/impact sensors.

Retrieve precise accident location via GPS.

Send instant alerts through SMS and phone calls to:

Emergency services (ambulance, nearby hospitals)

Designated family members

Allow customization of emergency contact list.

Provide quick medical assistance and reduce response delays.

🛑 Problem Statement

Road accidents often lead to fatalities due to delayed emergency response. The main issues are:

No immediate accident detection.

Lack of real-time location tracking.

No automated alert system to inform family/hospitals.

This project addresses these issues by combining sensors, GPS, and GSM to ensure timely notifications.
